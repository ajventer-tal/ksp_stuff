MISSION = Part 1: Basic Tritium Breeding
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = We are currently researching an exciting new form of nuclear power called "Fusion" which promisses some very exciting possibilities. However, to develop it, we would need some new fuels - which our current "Fission" reactors can create. Most importantly right now, we need you to start breeding tritium for us. We will also include a generator with this reactor to produce power for the next stages.
	Description = You need to build a dockable tritium production facility at KSC. You will need wheels to get it off the launch-pad and make sure you test your docking ports because we'll be adding more to it.
	Description = Hint: try building a standard wheeled undercariage with docking ports as a sub-assembly so all the parts can easilly be docked together later.
	Success = Wonderfull tritium production is proceeding nicely.
	SuggestedVesselName = Tritium Breeding Factory
	Condition = NoCrew
	Part = 3.75m "Aegletes 2" Nuclear Reactor
	Part = 3.75m Electric Generator
	Part = Lithium Tank
	Part = Deuterium Tritium Tank
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port

	
	Reward = 30000

        OBJECTIVE = Drive
        {
                Target = Kerbin
                Distance = 50
        }
	
	
	HINT = Enable Tritium Breeding, and return to the space center for the next mission
}

MISSION = Part 2: The science lab
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Our new portable science labs can do scientific research, produce antimatter and other resources and are all around wonderful. Only, we don't have any...
	Description = We want you to go put one out at KSC and dock it to your tritium factory (it can share the power generated and then we have a one stop dock-shop for all of this.
	Description = Authors note: There appears to be a bug in the way KSPStoryMissions handle ground-based docking objectives - so I have not included one until this is resolved.
	Success = For science ! 
	SuggestedVesselName = KSC Science Lab
	Condition = CrewRequired
	Part = Science Laboratory
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port
	Part = Communotron 88-88
	
	Reward = 30000
	
        OBJECTIVE = Drive
        {
                Target = Kerbin
                Distance = 50
        }
	

	HINT = Remain docked and return to the space center for the next mission
}
	
MISSION = Part 3: The ISRU
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = A miracle of compact science our new ISRU units are capable of obtaining numerous resources from planetary surfaces in order to refuel ships.
	Description = As a first test, we want you to build one and hook it up with the tritium breeding factory and science lab your already put up at KSC.
	Success = Just think of the possibilities -including keeping the reactor out there fueled.
	SuggestedVesselName = KSC ISRU
	Part = ISRU Refinery
	
	Reward = 30000
	
        OBJECTIVE = Drive
        {
                Target = Kerbin
                Distance = 50
        }
	

	HINT = Remain docked and return to the space center for the next mission
}
