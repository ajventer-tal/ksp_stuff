MISSION = Part 1: The floating fusion fuel factory
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Is it possible to have a single installation produce all the possible fusion fuels ?
	Description = We believe so - but doing it is another matter, because it means the factory has to float.
	Description = Get it built, get it dunked - and let's make some fuel.
	Success = Now all you have to do is dock your refueling ships with a floating space ship... good luck with that.
	SuggestedVesselName = Floating Fusion Fuel Factory
	Condition = CrewRequired
	Part = Computer Core
	Part = 1.25m Electric Generator
	Part = 1.25m "KIWI" Nuclear Reactor
	Part = Lithium Tank
	Part = Deuterium Tritium Tank
	Part = Helium-3 Tank
	Part = Science Laboratory
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port

	
	Reward = 30000

        OBJECTIVE = Splashdown
        {
                Target = Kerbin
        }
	
	
	HINT = Enable Tritium Breeding on the reactor, this will produce both tritium and HE3, enable centrifuge on the science lab.
}

MISSION = Part 2: Deuterium and Tritium
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Fusion reactors have several fuel modes, each good for a different job. Let's do some unmanned tests to see how they are different.
	Description = First of all, we will look at the default: deuterium and tritium - this produces very little electricity - but is very fuel efficient for rockets.
	Description = It won't be able to lift off from Kerbin, so we will use a booster to get us off the ground.
	Success = That was quite spectacular
	SuggestedVesselName = DT Fusion Rocket
	Condition = NoCrew
	Condition = OnBudget
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1
	Part = 1.25m OMEGA Fusion Reactor
	Part = 1.25m Thermal Rocket Nozzle
	Part = 62.5cm Electric Generator
	Part = FL-T100 Fuel Tank
	Part = Geomax Z200-37 Methane Tank
	Part = Deinonychus 1-D
	Part = Mk2-R Radial-Mount Parachute
	Part = Mk2-R Radial-Mount Parachute
	Reward = 25000

	OBJECTIVE = Orbit

		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 75000
	}

MISSION = Part 3: Deuterium and Helium-3
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Next we will test the combination of Deuterium and Helium-3
	Description = This combination has less fuel efficiency but produces more electrical power. 
	Success =

	Condition = NoCrew
	Condition = OnBudget
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1

MISSION = Part 4: Helium-3
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Next we will test a pure  Helium-3 reactor.
	Description = This fuel produces almost no thrust at all - but a massive amount of electricity. It's ideal for driving a Xenon-fueled plasma-thruster.
	Success = That was quite spectacular
	SuggestedVesselName = He3 Fusion Rocket
	Condition = NoCrew
	Condition = OnBudget
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1
