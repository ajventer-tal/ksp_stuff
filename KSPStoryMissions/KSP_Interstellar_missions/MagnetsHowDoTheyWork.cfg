MISSION = Part 1: Kerbin
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Apparently for each basic particle of matter, there is an antiparticle that is the same except for having the opposite electric charge. So for a proton for example, there is an antiproton which has negative charge, and an anti-electron has positive charge. Put those together and you get an anti-hydrogen atom. All of that is just theory though - the interesting thing is what happens when anti-matter meets normal matter - apparently it likes to explode, with extreme alacrity. The boys think this may be a powerful fuel for future space endeavours - but first we need to find some... a lot actually - and that's where you come in. We want you to build a magnetometer probe and put it in Orbit around Kerbin to look for antimatter in the planet's magnetic field. A highly eccentric orbit is best, so you can cover many altitudes.
	Description = We theorize that the strongest concentrations will be at the equator so an equatorial orbit is ideal.
	Description = Author note: KSPStoryMissions don't recognize the experiment so I couldn't set that as objectives - just remember to do the log analysis.
	Success = You found antimatter ? That's great ! I'll let the scientists know.
	SuggestedVesselName = Magnetosphere Probe
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1
	Part = Dual Technique Magnetometer
	Part = Communotron 16
	
	Reward = 15000

	OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
	{
		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 75000
		MaxAltitude = 80000
	}
	OBJECTIVE = ReachAltitude 
	{
		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 2000000
	}
	
	HINT = Recover the vessel or go to the space center for the next mission
}

MISSION = Part 2: Eve
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = We definitely found some antimatter there - but we think some other planets may have more. Why don't you send a probe to go check for antimatter around Eve next ?
	Success = More antimatter ? This stuff is more common than we thought.
	SuggestedVesselName = Magnetosphere Probe - Eve
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1
	Part = Dual Technique Magnetometer
	Part = Comms DTS-M1

	HINT = Recover the vessel or go to the space center for the next mission
}

MISSION = Part 3: Jool
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = We analyzed the results of your Eve mission, and concluded that the best places would have strong gravity, big atmospheres and strong magnetic fiels.
	Description = So the choice is obvious - go put a probe around Jool to see what you can see...
	Success = There is a lot of the stuff here ! 
	SuggestedVesselName = Magnetosphere Probe - Jool
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1
	Part = Dual Technique Magnetometer
