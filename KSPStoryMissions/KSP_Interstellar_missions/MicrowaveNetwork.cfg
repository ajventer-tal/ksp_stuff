MISSION = Part 1: The first orbital generator
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Thanks to new technology, we now have the means to transmit power from generators to spacecraft using microwave transcievers.
	Description = We want to build a microwave network to provide power to space-craft in the Kerbin system.

	Description = Our first step is to put a generator with a microwave transmitter into orbit. It needs to have an inclination of less than 30 degrees.
	Description = I reccomend adding docking ports so that you can later send up service missions to refuel the generators.

	Success = Also, it can make popcorn.
	SuggestedVesselName = Orbital Microwave Generator 1
	Part = 3.75m Electric Generator
	Part = 3.75m "Aegletes 2" Nuclear Reactor
	Part = Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
	
	Reward = 95000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 75000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Remain in orbit and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 2: The second orbital generator
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = One generator won't cut it for moving around the Kerbin system, you will require two more. The next one should be in an orbit of similiar height to the previous one.

	Success = Why build one when you can build two for twice the price ?
	SuggestedVesselName = Orbital Microwave Generator 2
	Part = 3.75m Electric Generator
	Part = 3.75m "Aegletes 2" Nuclear Reactor
	Part = Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
	
	Reward = 95000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 75000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Remain in orbit and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 3: The third orbital generator
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = One more should do it.

	Success = Three's company.
	SuggestedVesselName = Orbital Microwave Generator 3
	Part = 3.75m Electric Generator
	Part = 3.75m "Aegletes 2" Nuclear Reactor
	Part = Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
	
	Reward = 950000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 75000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Remain in orbit and return to the space center for the next mission. Remember to make sure the transcievers are in "transmitter" mode.
}

MISSION = Part 4: The first relay
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Now we will need to add some relays in order to ensure we can get power all the way to the Mun at least.
	Description = We need 3 relays in an circular,equatorial orbit at least 600km above Kerbin, roughly 120 degrees appart.
	Description = Hint: Using higher orbits gives you a larger margin of error in placing the relays. For example at 700km you have about 5 degrees of margin that still works.
	Description = Remember to set the transcievers to "relay" mode.

	Success = One for the money
	SuggestedVesselName = Orbital Microwave Relay 1
	Part = Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
	
	Reward = 50000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 600000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Remain in orbit and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 5: The second relay
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Time to put up the second relay - remember, it needs to be in much the same orbit as the first, roughly 120 degrees away

	Success = Two for the show
	SuggestedVesselName = Orbital Microwave Relay 2
	Part = Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
	
	Reward = 50000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 600000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Remain in orbit and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 6: The third relay
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = And time for number 3 - same orbit as before, but roughly 120 degrees from both the previous ones (that is about in the middle between them).

	Success = Three to get ready
	SuggestedVesselName = Orbital Microwave Relay 3
	Part = Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
	
	Reward = 50000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 600000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Remain in orbit and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 7: A microwave powered trip to the Mun
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Now we will build our first microwave powered ship (though you can reuse the network for many more) - and once you learn to deal with transmission issues you can expand it to cover the entire Kerbol solar system.
	Description = We will built a liquid-fuel plasma thruster ship which gets it's electrical charge via microwave transmission. Since microwave power doesn't work in the atmosphere - you will need a conventional rocket booster to put it up into orbit, from there it should be able to make as many as 10 trips to the Mun without needing to be refueled. You will need to put several microwave receivers on the ship to cover many angles between you and the relay network.
	Description = You can also extend the network by adding relays around the Mun itself so you can burn even when the Mun is between you and Kerbin.

	Success = And four to go.
	SuggestedVesselName = Microwave Powered Plasma Ship
	
	Part = Mk1 Cockpit
	Part = Mk2 Fuselage
	Part = 1.25m Plasma Thruster
	Part = Microwave Beamed Power Receiver
	Part = Microwave Beamed Power Receiver
	Part = Microwave Beamed Power Receiver
	
	Reward = 50000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Mun
		MinAltitude = 10000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Keep the ship in orbit and use it as needed, or replace it, up to you.
}
