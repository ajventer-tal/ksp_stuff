MISSION = Part 1: Basic Thermal Rocket
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = We have a theory that you could build a rocket that uses the temperature of a nuclear reactor to produce thrust. Of course that means the reactor would have to be directly connected to the rocket nozzle
	Description = We want you to test the idea. Put together a simple rocket using a nuclear reactor and a thermal rocket nozzle and see how high up you can go.
	Success = Okay - so not very high then ? Maybe these would work better as upper stage engines...
	SuggestedVesselName = Thermal Rocket Test
	Part = Mk1 Lander Can
	Part = Mk16-XL Parachute
	Part = 3.75m "Aegletes 2" Nuclear Reactor
	Part = 3.75m Thermal Rocket Nozzle
	Reward = 15000

	OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	
	OBJECTIVE = ReachAltitude
	{
		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 1000
	}
	HINT = Recover the vessel or go to the space center for the next mission
}

MISSION = Part 2: Nuclear orbit
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Well the theory works - and we think they could be very fuel efficient - but clearly, they don't have much thrust so not much use for take-off.
	Description = So... we want you to take one into orbit using conventional rocketry and then test it up there.
	Description = Launch it to a low kerbin orbit with normal rockets, then use the nuclear stage to change your orbit really high and see how much fuel you have left.
	Description = Remember to switch the rocket nozzle to Liquid-Only...
	Success = MMmm, incredible fuel efficiency - takes forever to get anywhere... hard to aim...lots of waste heat... let's see what the engineers can come up with.
	SuggestedVesselName = Thermal Rocket Orbital Test
	Part = Mk1 Lander Can
	Part = Mk16-XL Parachute
	Part = 1.25m "KIWI" Nuclear Reactor
	Part = 1.25m Thermal Rocket Nozzle
	Part = 2.5m Pure Liquid Fuel Tank
	//Part = 2.5m Inline Radiator - I originally required radiators but the trouble is that the convection radiatiors don't work well in space while the later ones do
	//I can't really know if the user has them available yet though - and if you're using convection you need far more radiator power than otherwise
	//so I'll let the player discover the significant heat issues and solve it as she sees fit.
	Part = Rockomax "Skipper" Liquid Engine
	Reward = 85000

	OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
	{
		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 75000
		MaxAltitude = 80000
	}
	//I originally intended the two orbit maneuvre simply to get the player to test the thermal rocket in orbit - as it happens, it's very slow burns mean that
	//at LKO levels it's almost impossible to steer - in fact you need to burn about halfway to 1000Km then go around and do the nect half or you end up turned around so far that you
	//burn in the wrong direction. After discovering this effect - I decided to leave it like that, it gives the player and interesting and fun challenge discovering the same thing.
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
	{
		Body = Kerbin

MISSION = Part 3: How do you organize a nuclear party ? You planet ! 
{
        From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
        Description = Based on your earlier orbital test, we've concluded these engines are best suited for high-orbit interplanetary transfers - so we will use  one to go visit Duna.
	Description = We will start with a simple fly-by mission to see Duna from space and do somce sciency stuff there. Use conventional rocketry to get into high orbit, then use the thermal rockets to get to Duna.
	Description = BTW. Our engineers think maybe we could use some of that waste heat to produce electric power... just a thought.
        Success = Oh, you made it back... and I planned so hard on your memorial. Nevermind, congratulations and all that.
