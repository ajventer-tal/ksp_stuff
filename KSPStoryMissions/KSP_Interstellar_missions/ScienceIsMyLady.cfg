MISSION = Part 1: Mun
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = After your successful construction of a science lab here at KSC - we have decided to put some out in the field to study those locations more closely.
	Description = Each of these locations were chosen for having significant scientific value and not being terribly hard to land on. Only, don't land too hard, the lab is full of glass vials and stuff.
	Description = For our first excursion - we're staying close to home - we want you to put a science lab on the Mun. Note that you will need two crew members in the science lab for it to function, the science lab works better the less stupid your chosen crew is. Also note that the Lab requires electrical power to function - how much depends on what you're doing with it.

	Description = The budgets for these missions are on the generous side - the reason is that they require a lot of permanent crew - which you will need money to recruit.
	Success = You ever get that feeling of Deja Vu ? 
	SuggestedVesselName = Mun Science Lab
	Part = Science Laboratory
	
	Reward = 150000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Land
        {
                Body = Mun
        }
	
	
	HINT = Let the lab do whatever you want it to and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 2: Ike
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = The Mun Lab was so successfull we want to put one on another moon - by our nearby neighbour Duna - on it's moon Ike.
	Success = We're already starting to get research reports. Well done.
	SuggestedVesselName = Ike Science Lab
	Part = Science Laboratory
	
	Reward = 250000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Land
        {
                Body = Ike
        }
	
	
	HINT = Let the lab do whatever you want it to and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 3: Jool
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Our next lab is a little different - we're not landing this time, just putting it in orbit around our favorite Gas Giant: Jool.
	Success = So much green stuff to study.
	SuggestedVesselName = Jool  Science Lab
	Part = Science Laboratory
	
	Reward = 300000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
        {
                Body = Jool
		MinAltitude = 140000
		MaxAltitude = 300000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Let the lab do whatever you want it to and return to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 4: Moho
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Finally we want to put a lab landed on planet. Specifically the planet Moho - which is tiny so it's easy to land on, but expensive to get in orbit around.
	Description = NOTE: This mission requires parts unlocked much later in the tree than the rest of this pack - you will be able to use the science labs already placed to help unlock them.
	Success = We've concluded it's a tiny, charred lump of rock.
	SuggestedVesselName = Moho  Science Lab
	Part = Science Laboratory
	Part = Computer Core
	
	Reward = 500000

        OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	OBJECTIVE = Land
        {
                Body = Moho
        }
	
	
	HINT = Let the lab do whatever you want it to and return to the space center for the next mission.
