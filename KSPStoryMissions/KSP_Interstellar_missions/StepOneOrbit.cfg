MISSION = Budget rocketry extreme.
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Methane, wonderful stuff, produced naturally by every Kerbin after eating beans - it's cheap and readily available. What's more - it turns out it's an excellent and efficent fuel for booster.
	Description = So efficient, we believe a single methane rocket and tank can make it all the way to orbit and back without any staging or parachutes - despite being a very heavy tank. Go see if our maths is correct.
	Description = You will probably want to land in the ocean... just to be safe.
	Success = It really worked ? Imagine how this will cut down the cost of our booster stages !
	SuggestedVesselName = Methane Rocket Test
	Part = Mk1 Lander Can
	Part = Geomax Ultra-75 Methane Tank
	Part = Deinonychus 1-D
