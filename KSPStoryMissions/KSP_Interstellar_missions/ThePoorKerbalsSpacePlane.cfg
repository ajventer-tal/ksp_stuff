MISSION = Part 1: Ground Based Microwave Relay
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = We previously managed to build a space plane without fuel using thermal jets - but what if we could ditch that heavy generator too ? New advances in microwave technology means this just may be possible.
	Description = But first, we'll need a ground-based microwave relay down here. 
	Description = Hint: If you did Charley and the Tritium Factory - you could conceivably just build a smaller relay and dock it with that.
	Success = I always say - if you're going to do it, overdo it.
	SuggestedVesselName = KSC Thermal Relay Station
	Part = Deployable Phased Array Microwave Transceiver
	
	Reward = 30000

	OBJECTIVE = Drive
	{
		Body = Kerbin
		Distance = 30
	}
	
	HINT = Leave the vessel here and go to the space center for the next mission
}

MISSION = Part 2: Test flight
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Now that we have our power source, we need to build a plane to test it with. 
	Description = Don't fly too far, or you won't get good signal and then you'll crash instead.
	Success = You're not really into the whole "landing" aircraft thing are you ?
	SuggestedVesselName = Microwave Jet
	Part = MTER-S Microwave Thermal Receiver
	Part = 1.25m Thermal Turbojet
	
	Reward = 20000

	OBJECTIVE = ReachAltitude
	{
		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 600
	}
	
	HINT = Recover the vessel or go to the space center for the next mission
}

MISSION = Part 3: To Space !
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = We've proven we can get into the air with this, and at least while in the atmosphere it can fly. But if you add some fuel it should work in space too - and we already have a microwave network up there.
	Description = Why don't you try build one that can get into orbit ? And bring it back whole this time...
	Description = NOTE: It is not possible to complete this mission until you unlock the upgraded thermal turbojet. Even then, this is hard and requires some luck (especially wrt orbital positions of your microwave satelites).
	Success = Well... that was some tricky flying wasn't it ?
	SuggestedVesselName = Microwave SSTO
	Part = MTER-S Microwave Thermal Receiver
	Part = 1.25m Thermal Turbojet
	
	Reward = 30000

	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
	{
		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 75000
	}
	OBJECTIVE = Land
	{
		Body = Kerbin
	}
	
	HINT = Recover the vessel or go to the space center for the next mission
