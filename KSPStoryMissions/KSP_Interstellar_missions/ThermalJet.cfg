MISSION = Part 1: Basic Nuclear Jets
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Nuclear powered jet engines work by heating up air and thrusting it out the back, they produce low thrust but require no additional fuel and can run as long as the reactor does.
	Description = We want you to build and test-fly a nuclear powered Thermal Jet plane.
	Success = You were gone rather long weren't you ?
	SuggestedVesselName = Basic Thermal Jet
	Part = 1.25m Thermal Turbojet
	Part = 1.25m "KIWI" Nuclear Reactor
	
	Reward = 15000

		Body = Kerbin
		MinAltitude = 600
