MISSION = Kerbin Antimatter Collection
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = We've been analyzing the antimatter location data you gathered a while ago - and with new technologies we believe are now capable of harvesting and storing antimatter for use in energy production in the near future.
	Description = Jool is the best place we've found for this - but it's far to go and get the results, so we'll set up a harvesting location closer to home first.
	Description = To maximize gain you need to be in an equatorial orbit at exactly the right height.

	Success = What's the matter then ?
	SuggestedVesselName = Kerbin Antimatter Collector
	Part = Computer Core
	Part = Antimatter Collector

		MinAltitude = 690000
		MaxAltitude = 710000
        }
	
	
	HINT = Remain in orbit and return to the space center for the next mission. Visit regularly to pick your antimatter.
}

MISSION = Jool Antimatter Collection
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = As mentioned we also want to put a collector up around Jool. Jool has much stronger magnetic fields and will yield Antimatter faster, so take an extra containment device.

	Success = 'Cause we're living in matterial world antimatterial girl...

MISSION = KSC Antimatter Production
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = There is now two antimatter refuel stations in our solar system - allowing for a small top-up near here and a very large refil at Jool - together they should fuel you for almost any trip.
	Description = But without some on the ground here at KSC, your AM reactors won't even be able to switch on until you get to dock with the Kerbin orbital collector.
	Description = Luckilly our science labs can also make antimatter, though only at very slow rates. Still, if you put one up here, it can give you a small initial supply to power your engines up to the Kerbin Collector.
	Description = You need a source of power to maintain the antimatter container and lab, if you set up a local microwave station you can use beamed power, else you will need to add a nuclear reactor and generator.

	Success = Don't react or you'll make your aunty madder

        {
                Body = Kerbin
		Distance = 50
        }
	
	
	HINT = Park it near the launch pad. enable antimatter production and use it to provide launch fuel for your antimatter ships.
}


MISSION = Antimatter is handy-matter.
{
	From = KSC Insterstellar Sciences Dept
	Description = Now we can take out antimatter sources for a test drive. While you can do it with just an antimatter drive, it's reccomended to add a fusion drive to power the containment system when you're not burning to preserve your actual antimatter for the engines. 
	Description = For a first test we will build a small antimatter rocket, you will fuel it partly from the launchpad at the factory, then launch and dock with the Kerbin collector and refuel. From there you will travel to jool where you will refuel once more for a return trip back to Kerbin.

	Success = An antiproton walked into a bar... the bar exploded.
