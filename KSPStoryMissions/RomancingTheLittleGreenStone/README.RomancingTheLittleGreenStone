This is a mission pack built around the design of science in KSP 0.23, and making use of the new mobile science lab.
It lets you set up a permanent science and refuel station in orbit around MinMus - then build a small manned science vessel. The small vessel can then
visit the various Minmus biomes and return the data for processing to maximize the gain you can get without return missions.
It's designed to fit in with the budget system of KSPStoryMissions as subsequent research trips don't involve building new rockets - they therefore don't impact your budget.
