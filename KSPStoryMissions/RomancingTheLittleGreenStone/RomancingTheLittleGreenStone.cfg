MISSION = Part 1: The Science Lab
{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept
	Description = We learned a great deal from your trip to the Mun, but it cost a fortune. We want to study Minmus - all over, so we spoke to the engineering guys and came up with a cheaper way to do that.
        Description = Well cheaper in the long run, it will cost rather more initially. See the expensive part of studying Minmus is getting there - every trip costs a fortune. So we want to build a science lab in orbit around it
        Description = With a refueling station attached. Then you can have a manned probe go down to various parts of Minmus to collect data, bring them back to the lab to be processed and transmit them home. Refuel the probe and go do it somewhere else.
	Success = Right, the lab is in orbit, now tell me you remembered to put scientists in it ?
	SuggestedVesselName = Minmus Orbital Lab
	Condition = CrewRequired
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port

	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
	{
		Body = Minmus
		MinAltitude = 10000
		MaxAltitude = 20000
	}

	HINT = Remain in orbit and go to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 2: Refueling Ship
{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept
	Description = Now our small probe won't get to do many trips unless we can refuel it - so we want to attach a small unmanned ship with a big fuel tank to the lab, which will allow the lab to refuel the probe.
	Description = Take the biggest fuel tank you have ! We don't want to swap it out any sooner than we have to ! 
	Success = Couldn't you have used a bigger fuel tank?
	SuggestedVesselName = Minmus Refueling Station
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port
	Part = RV-105 RCS Thruster Block

	}

	HINT = Remain docked and go to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 3: Dock the probe
{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept
	Description = Allright, so now that we have our lab/fuel station in orbit, we need to send up a small manned research lander and dock that to it.
	Success = Wonderful ! Now we can just bounce up and down to study the whole little moon.
	SuggestedVesselName = Minmus Research Lander
	Part = Command Pod Mk1
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port
	Part = RV-105 RCS Thruster Block
	Part = SC-9001 Science Jr.
	Part = Mystery Goo™ Containment Unit
	Part = 2HOT Thermometer
	
	Reward = 15000
	OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	{
		Body = Minmus
		MinAltitude = 10000
		MaxAltitude = 20000
	}


	OBJECTIVE = Dock
	{
		TargetVessel = Part 1: The Science Lab
	}

	HINT = Remain docked and go to the space center for the next mission.

}

MISSION = Part 4: The first research trip
	Description = Right, our lab has all it's parts, time to land somewhere on Minmus and collect some scientific data ! 
	Success = The area where you landed is apparently not made of desert. The quest for yummy peppermint continues...


	StartVessel = Part 3:  Dock the probe
	Reward = 1000

		TargetVessel =  Part 1: The Science Lab
	}
	OBJECTIVE = Science
	{
		Science = Process Lab Data
	}
	HINT = Leave the lab here - you can do many research trips to different biomes without needing additional budget
	HINT = If you did the SCANsat missions (and have SCANsat parts) you will be able to identify the biomes on the maps
	HINT = If your refuel tank runs empty - the third docking port allows you to take up another refuel ship to refill it. This will however cost against your budget so plan accordingly.
