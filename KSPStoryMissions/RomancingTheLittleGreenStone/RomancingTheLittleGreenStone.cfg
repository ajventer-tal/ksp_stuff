MISSION = Part 1: The Science Lab
{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept
	Description = We learned a great deal from your trip to the Mun, but it cost a fortune. We want to study Minmus - all over, so we spoke to the engineering guys and came up with a cheaper way to do that.
        Description = Well cheaper in the long run, it will cost rather more initially. See the expensive part of studying Minmus is getting there - every trip costs a fortune. So we want to build a science lab in orbit around it
        Description = With a refueling station attached. Then you can have a manned lander go down to various parts of Minmus to collect data, bring them back to the lab to be processed and transmit them home. Refuel the lander and go do it somewhere else.
        Description = You will have to put some sort of solar panels or nuclear generators on it - science labs need power and need to be able to recharge their batteries. You don't need to add extra fuel at this stage.
	Success = Right, the lab is in orbit, now tell me you remembered to put scientists in it ?
	SuggestedVesselName = Minmus Orbital Lab
	//The crew required section doesn't seem  to work - science labs are uncrewed by default but the mission is designed around the user putting them in - there's no mission budget for flying up
	//kerbonaughts afterward
	Condition = CrewRequired
	Part = Stayputnik Mk. 1

	OBJECTIVE = LaunchKSC
	
	OBJECTIVE = EnterSOI
        {
             Body = Minmus
	}

	OBJECTIVE = ReachAltitude
	{
		Body = Minmus
		MinAltitude = 10000
		MaxAltitude = 20000
	}

	OBJECTIVE = Orbit
	{

	}

	HINT = Remain in orbit and go to the space center for the next mission.
}

MISSION = Part 2: Refueling Ship
{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept
	Description = Now our small lander won't get to do many trips unless we can refuel it - so we want to attach a small unmanned ship with a big fuel tank to the lab, which will allow the lab to refuel the lander.
	Description = Take the biggest fuel tank you have ! We don't want to swap it out any sooner than we have to ! You should also take extra monopropellant so you can refuel the lander's RCS systems later.
	Description = Obviously  you should try not to use any of the payload fuel during the trip. That's for the lander later.
	Description = The science lab needs two full time crew members - if you forgot to add them when you sent it up, you'll have to add some room on this ship to take them along. Otherwise an unmanned lander module is fine.
	Success = Couldn't you have used a bigger fuel tank?
	SuggestedVesselName = Minmus Refueling Station
	Part = Clamp-O-Tron Docking Port

	}


	OBJECTIVE = Dock
	{
		TargetVessel = Part 1: The Science Lab
	}

	HINT = Remain docked and go to the space center for the next mission. If you brought your science operators along on this mission - you will need to EVA them to the lab before you can complete the final mission.
}

MISSION = Part 3: Dock the lander
{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept
	Description = Allright, so now that we have our lab/fuel station in orbit, we need to send up a small manned research lander and dock that to it.
	Success = Wonderful ! Now we can just bounce up and down to study the whole little moon.

{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept

MISSION = Part 5: The voyage home
{
	From = KSC Scientific Exploration Dept
	Description = ******* WARNING ! DO NOT START THIS MISSION UNTIL YOU ARE DONE EXPLORING ALL THE MINMUS BIOMES YOU WANT TO EXPLORE****
	Description = ******* RECCOMEND NOT TRANSMITTING THE FINAL ONE - BRING THE DATA OVER VIA EVA AND INCLUDE IT IN THE RECOVERY TO MAXIMIZE SCIENCE POINTS*****
	Description = Our Kerbonaughts in the Minmus Orbital labs are getting rather bored up there after all this time. I think it's time we send up a ship to bring them home
