MISSION = Part 1: Kerbin
{
	From = KSC Geographical Sciences Dept
	Description = We had a great idea ! We could draw really accurate maps if we did it from space... or at least pretty ones! 
	Description = So what we're thinking is - let's put a satelite in a polar orbit around Kerbin, with mapping gear on it, map the planet and transmit the data back for science.
	Description = So go do er... what we just said. 
	Success = Mmm... wait, what's that big white place up here ?
