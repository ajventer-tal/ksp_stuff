These are very much WIP missions to put mapping satelites in orbit around various moons and planets.
It's broken up into two parts - one for the Kerbin system (unlocked relatively early) and one for other planets (unlocked much later).

Due to some (current) limitations in KSPStoryMissions it does not require you to actually USE the satelites, nor establish a proper polar orbit,
you just need to get an orbit in scanning range to get the mission - the rest is up to you, on the upside this means these missions should work well with
either SCANSat or ISA_MapSAT (though I haven't tested the budget amounts against ISA_MapSAT). 
With SCANSat this is a good way to earn some science.
