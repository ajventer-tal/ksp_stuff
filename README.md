Various bits and pieces for KSP


rtplacer.py
A simple python script which helps build remotetech networks. 
The idea is that you put all your satelites on one launch vehicle 
in a lower orbit. Then you raise the AP to the network orbit.
Release the first satelite and circularize it's orbit,
warp until the orbital encounter is the right angle from that 
satelite and release the next.
RTPlacer will calculate how long you have to warp for and give
you are result both as number or orbits (of the launch vehicle)
and as a time.

~~KSPStoryMissions: custom missions for the KSPStoryMissions mod.~~
The mod this was for no longer exists.
